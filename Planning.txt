---Before The Game---
*Describe size of the game board. (10x10)
*Describe number and name of colors. (6; blue,green,pink,purple,red,yellow)
*Describe four icon types. (default,A,B,C)
*Describe four conditions for icon type. Icons change according to how many groups.(4<7<10)
*Create colorful blocks on the game board. If there is a deadlock, organize colorful blocks reply without any deadlock.

---During The Game---
*The gamer clicks a group. This group must be greater than 2 to be a group. 
*If any group has not less 2 group, colors must be organizated at the game board without any deadlock.
*Group is blasted. In this case, there is a blast animation here.
*New colorful blocks are created and they must shown as up to down.

---Performance Optimization Problems---
*Deadlock (Solution: Shuffle blocks randomly, select a block, teleport it to block which has same color)
*New colorful blocks instead of blasted blocks (Solution: Randomly object pooling)
*Gravity with rigidbody (Solution: Use down movement instead of rigidbody)
*Many draw calls (Solution: Sprite atlas)
*Finding same neighboor colorful blocks (Solution: Use a list to find neighboorhoods)
